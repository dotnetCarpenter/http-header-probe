14.2 Accept-Charset

  The Accept-Charset request-header field can be used to indicate what
  character sets are acceptable for the response. This field allows
  clients capable of understanding more comprehensive or special-
  purpose character sets to signal that capability to a server which is
  capable of representing documents in those character sets.

    Accept-Charset = "Accept-Charset" ":"
            1#( ( charset | "*" )[ ";" "q" "=" qvalue ] )

  Character set values are described in section 3.4. Each charset MAY
  be given an associated quality value which represents the user's
  preference for that charset. The default value is q=1. An example is

    Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1;q=0.8

  The special value "*", if present in the Accept-Charset field,
  matches every character set (including ISO-8859-1) which is not
  mentioned elsewhere in the Accept-Charset field. If no "*" is present
  in an Accept-Charset field, then all character sets not explicitly
  mentioned get a quality value of 0, except for ISO-8859-1, which gets
  a quality value of 1 if not explicitly mentioned.

  If no Accept-Charset header is present, the default is that any
  character set is acceptable. If an Accept-Charset header is present,
  and if the server cannot send a response which is acceptable
  according to the Accept-Charset header, then the server SHOULD send
  an error response with the 406 (not acceptable) status cod
